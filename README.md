Implementation Overview:

This Node.js application uses a variety of libraries to meet the assignment requirements. Below is a high-level approach to implementing the project:

Required Libraries:

Data Scraping: Axios for making HTTP requests to Hacker News and Cheerio for parsing the HTML content.
Real-Time Updates: ws to handle WebSocket connections for broadcasting updates in real-time.
Database Integration: mysql2 (or sequelize as an alternative ORM) to interact with the MySQL database for storing and retrieving data.
Scheduling: node-cron to run periodic tasks, specifically for scraping Hacker News every 5 minutes.

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

npm install axios cheerio ws mysql2 node-cron express


Step 2: Set Up MySQL Database
Create a MySQL database called hackernews:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE hackernews;
Create a table for stories:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stories (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    url VARCHAR(255),
    time_published DATETIME,
    score INT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Update the dbConfig object in server.js with your MySQL credentials:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const dbConfig = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root',            // MySQL username
    password: 'yourpassword',  // MySQL password
    database: 'hackernews'    // Your MySQL database name
};


Step 3: Start MySQL Server
Make sure your MySQL server is running and that youâ€™ve created the database hackernews as described above.

Step 4: Run the Server
After installing the necessary libraries and setting up MySQL, run the Node.js server by executing the following command in your project directory:


node server.js
This will start the server on port 8080 and listen for incoming WebSocket connections.

Step 3: Open the Client
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the live updates from Hacker News.

Scraping Hacker News:

Cheerio is used to extract relevant information such as story IDs, titles, and URLs from Hacker News.
The data scraping process is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, using node-cron, to fetch the latest stories automatically.
WebSocket Streaming:

When a new client connects, the server sends it stories from the last 5 minutes.
As new stories are scraped, the server pushes real-time updates to all connected clients, ensuring they always receive the most current stories.

MySQL Integration:

The application ensures a stories table is created in the MySQL database if it doesn't already exist.
To prevent duplicate entries, the server uses INSERT IGNORE when saving stories, ensuring each story is stored only once based on its unique ID.

Server:

The server combines the Express framework for handling HTTP requests and serving static files with WebSocket for broadcasting real-time updates to clients.
